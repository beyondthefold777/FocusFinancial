      <p>
        Focus Financial provides simple, secure access to stablecoins like USDT (TRC-20, Ethereum) and USDC, helping clients in the Caribbean and beyond transact digitally with confidence.

        Our service is designed to bridge the gap between traditional banking and modern crypto finance. Clients send a wire transfer in USD, and we handle the conversion and delivery of the chosen stablecoin directly to your wallet address.
